# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Signals and streams are first-class primitives — not adapters or plugins — so real-time UIs feel as natural to write as static ones.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — Package Quality

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 10 (Package Quality)
Plan: 04 (completed)
Status: Executing phase 7
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — 07-04 complete (streams edge case tests + fromReadable bug fix)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33% (v1.1 — 4 of 12 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0 baseline):**
- Total plans completed: 21
- Average duration: ~4 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~42 min

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01–06 (v1.0) | 21 | ~42min | ~2min |

**v1.1 metrics:** Not started

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 07 P03 | 4 | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 07-package-quality P04 | 2 | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0: LIT-04 type augmentation not in dist/ — Phase 7 ships the fix (LIT-01)
- v1.0: HMR state preservation, E2E CLI scaffold, and performance profiling require interactive environments — Phase 8 (E2E) and Phase 9 (benchmarks) handle these
- Roadmap: Phase 8 and Phase 9 can run in parallel once Phase 7 is complete (no cross-dependency)
- Roadmap: Phase 10 depends on both Phase 7 (style objects) and Phase 9 (benchmark data for bar chart)
- [Phase 07]: Used onError prop (Approach A) for Suspense async error propagation — cleaner, testable API vs DOM event dispatch (07-03)
- [Phase 07]: Suspense onError is optional, backward-compatible fallback to console.error — no breaking change (07-03)
- [Phase 07-04]: Fixed fromReadable bug: non-cancellation errors preserve status=error (not overwritten by status=closed)

### Pending Todos

### Blockers/Concerns
